# Marketing copy — Maya Workflow Kit (steps 122, 125)

English, US market, brand mode, landing page / store listing / README / social. Claims only about implemented
features (`docs/distribution/listing.md` part B is the fact base); no "exactly like Maya", no "100 %", no claims about
other products, no implied Autodesk endorsement; Maya only to describe compatibility. The trademark notice below is
kept in every long text.

## Name (decision 12 revision, 2026-10-20 — user decision)

- Product / store name: **Maya Workflow Kit** (no "Blender" in the store name, ToS 2.1). Repository / README title:
  **Maya Workflow Kit for Blender** (`https://github.com/5hyuns/maya-workflow-kit-for-blender`).
- The name is always followed at once by the context **"for Maya users, in Blender"** — the second line of the lockup
  (`compose.lockup()`, style.md) and the first sentence of every long text. "Maya" is not coloured or styled apart
  from the rest of the name.
- The name puts Maya first, which Autodesk's trademark guidelines advise against (they prefer "for Maya"); the user
  chose it knowing that. If the store review objects, the fallback is **Workflow Kit for Maya Users**
  (`docs/user_decisions.md` 12). Before step 125 the name was "Allset for Maya Users"; the run notes below keep it.

## How the headlines were made

The `copy-masters` agency workflow (plugin `ad-copy-agency-skill`), run 2026-10-20, files in
the 2026-10-20 listing copy run (local notes, not tracked): raw material (47 product facts from the
listing, 48 Maya-user voices from Blender Artists / Reddit / Polycount, 34 competitor ad lines) → planner brief →
CD surgery (PASS) → three teams in sequence (99 lines, 15 routes) → CD round 1 (5 routes, 15 lines kept) → rework
and defenses (40 + 3) → CD round 2 (shortlist 5) → client check (fact / FTC-style regulation check, 1 line caught) →
final + 2 alternates. Process check 45 / 45.

- Planner's reframe (change the problem type): Maya users don't stall for lack of information about what Allset
  rebuilds; they fear a Maya setup cuts them off from Blender itself (tutorials stop matching their keys). Allset's
  answer is that nothing changes until they choose Maya and plain Blender is one click away.
- Single-minded proposition: *Work the Maya way in Blender today, and get plain Blender back in one click whenever you
  want it.*

## Tagline (store field, ≤ 64 characters — decision 12, unchanged)

The whole Maya workflow in Blender, in one install

## Headlines

| Use | Headline | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Final** (README top, social lead, store featured caption) | The tutorial ends. Your Channel Box comes back. | copy-masters final (team B, route "switch to plain Blender for a tutorial, switch back") |
| Alternate | "Just use the default keymap." One click away. | copy-masters alternate (answers the forum advice; the switch restores the keymap the user had before Maya mode) |
| Alternate | Your first cube is called pCube1. | copy-masters alternate (defense accepted) |
| Shortlist | You quit over shortcuts, not over Blender. | CD shortlist (not picked by the client; usable for social) |
| Key visual | The whole Maya workflow in Blender, in one install. | the tagline |

Rejected by the client's fact check: "You installed it. Blender didn't notice." — installing adds the switch, an Edit
menu entry, a shortcut and the welcome dialog, so the headline is not literally true.

## Feature titles and lines (captioned screenshots, `tools/marketing/content.json`)

| # | Screen | Title (≤ 6 words) | Line (≤ 12 words) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hotbox | The hotbox, under the space bar | Hold Space for every menu of the current menu set. |
| 2 | Marking menus | Right-click marking menus | Object and component menus in Maya's radial positions, with gestures. |
| 3 | Channel Box & AE | Channel Box and Attribute Editor | Type +=5, see keyed channels in red, browse node tabs. |
| 4 | Menus / shelves | Menu sets, shelves, option boxes | F2–F6 menu sets, factory shelves, option windows with Maya's defaults. |
| 5 | Navigation & selection | Navigate and select the Maya way | Alt + mouse to tumble, QWERTY tools, F8 components, Maya selection colors. |

| 8 | Rigging | Joints, IK and skin weights | Joint Tool, IK handles, Bind Skin and Paint Skin Weights. |
| 9 | Modeling Toolkit | Modeling Toolkit, docked | Multi-component selection and the mesh tools in one panel. |
| 10 | Switch & revert | Nothing changes until you choose | Click Blender in the switch and everything the kit changed comes back. |

Fact base per line (listing.md part B): hotbox / marking menus = "Hotbox & Marking Menus"; `+=5`, keyed colours, node
tabs = "Channel Box & Attribute Editor"; F2–F6, shelves, option windows with Maya 2022 factory values = "Menu Sets &
Shelves" + "Option windows"; Alt + mouse, QWERTY, F8, selection colours, D / X / C / V holds = "Navigate & Select";
Time Slider / Range Slider / tangents / Auto Key = steps 56, 70, 73; Joint Tool / IK / Bind Skin / Paint Skin Weights =
steps 57–58; Modeling Toolkit = step 63; switch / revert = "What happens when you enable it" + "How to go back".

## Store preview captions (≤ 255 characters each)

1. Hold Space anywhere in the viewport: the hotbox shows every menu of the current menu set, Recent Commands and the marking-menu zones.
2. Right-click over an object or component for Maya's marking menus, in Maya's radial positions, with gestures and click mode.
3. Channel Box and Attribute Editor: keyed channels in red, +=5 and *=2 entry, Maya node tabs, docked next to the viewport.
4. Rigging menu set (F3) with option boxes that open Maya option windows with Maya 2022's factory values, and the Rigging shelf.
5. Component selection on a mesh with Maya selection colors and the Move manipulator; Alt + mouse navigation and QWERTY tools.
6. Hold D to edit the pivot; right-click while editing for the pivot marking menu. X, C and V snap while held.
7. Time Slider with key ticks and Range Slider, Graph Editor with Maya menus and tangents on Rain's keyed wave.
8. Paint Skin Weights on Rain's skinned body: influences list, Replace / Add / Scale / Smooth, joints drawn in front.
9. The Modeling Toolkit docked in the tab stack: multi-component selection, mesh, component and tool buttons.
10. Installing changes nothing: the welcome dialog asks first, and the Maya | Blender switch gives Blender back in one click.

## Clips (step 123, `tools/marketing/content.json` → `clips`, `trailer`)

Each clip's band shows its title (≤ 6 words) and, beat by beat, one line of what happens now (written in
`tools/marketing/clips.py` next to the action it describes) plus the keys pressed. Captions = store captions.

| # | Clip | Title | Store caption (≤ 255 characters) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | trailer | (key visual title card → clips → end card) | Maya Workflow Kit in half a minute: hotbox, marking menus, Channel Box keys, Maya navigation, pivot snapping, rigging, and the one-click switch back to plain Blender. |
| 1 | hotbox | The hotbox, under the space bar | Tap Space to toggle one view and four views; hold Space for the hotbox with every menu of every menu set. Here: Select > All, straight from the hotbox. |
| 2 | marking_menu | Right-click marking menus | Right-click over an object for its marking menu in Maya's positions: drag to Vertex for component mode, right-click again for Object Mode. |
| 3 | channel_box_keys | Key it in the Channel Box | S keys every channel and the Channel Box turns red; type +=90 into Rotate Z, Channels > Key Selected keys only that channel, then scrub the Time Slider. |
| 4 | navigation | Navigate the Maya way | Alt + left drag tumbles, Alt + middle drag tracks, Alt + right drag dollies; click an object and press F to frame it, A to frame everything. |
| 5 | pivot_snap | Edit the pivot, snap with V | Insert edits the pivot; hold V while dragging and it snaps to a corner of the battery. Insert again, and the battery rotates around its new pivot. |
| 6 | rigging | Joints, IK and skin weights | From the Rigging shelf: Create Joints by clicking, an IK Handle from shoulder to wrist, Bind Skin, pull the handle, then Paint Skin Weights. |
| 7 | switch | Maya or Blender, one click | One click on Blender in the top-bar switch gives plain Blender back with the same scene; one click on Maya brings the Maya layout, keys and colors back. |

Trailer end card: name, "for Maya users, in Blender", the final headline "The tutorial ends. Your Channel Box comes back.", "Free and open source · Blender 5.0 – 5.2",
and "Get it on extensions.blender.org" (placeholder until the listing is live; the listing URL is the platform's, from the id `allset`).

## Short intro (≤ 40 words)

For Maya users, in Blender: Maya Workflow Kit brings the hotbox, marking menus, Channel Box, menu sets, shelves and
option boxes. It changes nothing until you choose Maya; one click on the Maya | Blender switch gives plain Blender back.

## Long intro (≈ 120 words)

Maya Workflow Kit is for Maya users, in Blender. Moving from Maya to Blender is rarely about keys alone. It is the hotbox under the space bar, the right-click marking
menu over an object, the Channel Box where you type `+=5`, the menu sets and shelves, the option box next to a menu
item, and objects that behave like Maya transforms. The kit, a free and open-source Blender extension, rebuilds those
on top of Blender's own tools: Maya-style navigation and selection, Freeze and Delete History, joints, IK and skin
weights, the Time Slider and Graph Editor, the Modeling Toolkit. Installing it changes nothing until you choose Maya.
When a tutorial uses Blender's own keys, click Blender in the Maya | Blender switch, follow along, and switch back.
